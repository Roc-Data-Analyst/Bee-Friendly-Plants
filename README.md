# Bee Haven Revealed: Unlocking the Top Plant Species for Thriving Pollinator Bee Populations

Welcome to my Jupyter Notebook project! This repository contains an interactive and insightful Jupyter Notebook that showcases my data analysis project. Read on to learn more about the project.

## Project Overview

In this Jupyter Notebook, I have explored and analyzed native and non-native plants and their effects on pollinator bees. My task was to analyze this data and provide recommendations on which plants create an optimized environment for pollinator bees. Whether it's a dataset exploration, or any other data-related endeavor, this notebook aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the subject matter.
